//Create a container called names and have  5 different names of people stored inside

// Ex: var names= ["Eric", "Sara", "Rick","Jill","Kira"];

//Create a for loop of 3 objects that makes calls to the person.js file and store it in an array called people

//Randomly generate a name out of the names array by doing a random number between 0 and 4 to indicate which index the name is in

//Randomly generate a number for the row do not hard code the number for the row

//Create a function and have it output the persons name and job on the page

//No duplicate names are allowed

//Set the interval to 30 times a second
//ex: setInterval(runUpdate, 1000/30);
